# Merging

## Auto-merge [details](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request)

The pull request will merge automatically when all **required reviews** are met and all **required status checks have passed**.
**_Auto-merge must be enabled for the repository_**

After you enable auto-merge for a pull request, if **someone who does not have write permissions** to the repository **pushes new changes to the head branch or switches the base branch** of the pull request, **auto-merge will be disabled**.
